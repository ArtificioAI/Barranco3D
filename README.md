# Barranco3D
A geo-spatial repository of the district of Barranco in Lima, Peru for applications in Autonomous Driving.

## Current Project Status:
Update as of August 11, 2025:

🇵🇪 Mapping Barranco: [ 🟩🟨🟨⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜ ] (~10%): Here we show a first iteration of a sparse point-cloud computed from a small number of drone flights (Trajectories shown in Red) of the Main Square "The Plaza de Armas" with 'Av. Bolognesi' & 'Av. San Martin'. Using photogrammetry we can estimate the general structure of the buildings and roads. This information is important for general purpose geo-spatial intelligence applications in addition to updated maps for Autonomous Vehicles.

🚗 We will soon be adding the view-point of vehicles that go through the district to scale the coverage to take advantage of multi-view geometry for 3D reconstruction of the district while preserving the privacy of residents, vehicles, pedestrians & buildings, through sparse point-cloud structure and without dense reconstructions. 

🔗 We will be posting an open-source link of the map soon!
